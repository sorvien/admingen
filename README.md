An instant, "headless" admin panel for modern JavaScript backends, built on **ElysiaJS** and **Drizzle ORM**.

This framework introspects your Drizzle schema, auto-generates a secure API, and provides a dynamic, pre-built React UI to manage your data.

> **Note:** A 15-second GIF showing the final, working admin panel is the perfect demo to add here.

## ✨ Core Features

- **Zero-Config API:** Automatically generates a full REST API from your existing Drizzle schema.
- **Dynamic UI:** The React frontend (built with TanStack) dynamically renders tables, filters, and sorting based on your API schema.
- **Server-side Operations:** Efficiently handle large datasets with server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering.
- **Intelligent Introspection:** Automatically detects enums, required fields, and read-only columns.
- **Plug-and-Play:** Add it to your existing Elysia server in just a few lines of code.
- **Modern Stack:** Built on the fastest, most modern tools: Bun, Elysia, and Drizzle.
- **Open Source:** MIT-licensed, built in public by **[@blackwaves](https://github.com/blackwavesdev)**.

## 🚦 Status: MVP Ready

This project is now **MVP Ready**. The core functionality including Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) is complete, with server-side support for performance and scalability.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get your admin panel running in 3 minutes.

### 1. Installation

In your existing Elysia + Drizzle project, install the core framework, the Drizzle adapter, and all required peer dependencies.

````bash
# Install the core framework and the Drizzle adapter
bun add @blackwaves/admingen@beta @blackwaves/admingen-adapter-drizzle@beta

# Install required peer dependencies
bun add elysia drizzle-orm @sinclair/typebox

### 2. Usage

Add the following to your main Elysia server file (e.g., `src/index.ts`):

```ts
import { Elysia } from 'elysia';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/bun-sqlite';
import { Database } from 'bun:sqlite';
import * as schema from './src/schema'; // Your Drizzle schema

import { AdminGen } from '@blackwaves/admingen';
import { createDrizzleAdapter } from '@blackwaves/admingen-adapter-drizzle';

// Set up Drizzle with Bun SQLite
const sqlite = new Database('sqlite.db');
const db = drizzle(sqlite, { schema });

// Create the adapter for AdminGen
const adapterResult = createDrizzleAdapter({ schema });

const app = new Elysia()
  // Make the db instance available in the Elysia context for plugins/adapters
  .decorate('db', db)
  .use(
    AdminGen({
      adapterResult,
      adminPath: '/admin', // Optional: customize your admin URL prefix
    })
  )
  .listen(3000);

console.log('🦊 Admin panel running at http://localhost:3000/admin');
````

### 3. Run It!

Follow these steps to launch your admin panel:

```bash
# (Optional) Prepare your database tables using Drizzle
bunx drizzle-kit generate

# Start the development server
bun run dev
```

## 3. Launch the Admin Panel

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin)  
You should now see your full admin panel, displaying all data from your Drizzle database tables.
